  <h1>The best Movies According to Sriharan</h1>
  <h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>Spider man No way Home</h3>
  <p>
    The fact that they got all three spidermans on the same screen was what made
    the movie very cool.

  <h3>Avatar</h3>
  <p>
    Old is gold. The first avatar film is by far the best movie of it's time
